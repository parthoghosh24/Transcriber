Transcriber
===========
Transcriber is my shot at speech to text translation system. Used sphinx 4 java framework developed by CMU. The goal for the project
is to develop a transcription software which can convert an audio file into text. Was getting near about 50 to 60 % accuracy in some resonable time.
But that was not good enough. May work in this in future.
